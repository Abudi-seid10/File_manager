# File Organizer

File Organizer is a Python script that organizes files in a directory based on their file type. The script uses a simple GUI created with the tkinter library to allow the user to select a directory to organize.

## Features

- Organizes files in a directory based on their file type
- Supports multiple file types, including images and videos
- Simple GUI for easy use
- Progress bar to show the progress of the file organization process
- Works on nested folders

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (included with most Python installations)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `file_organizer.py` file.
3. Run the script by typing `python file_organizer.py` and pressing Enter.
4. Use the GUI to select the directory you want to organize.
5. Click the "Start" button to begin the file organization process.
6. Wait for the script to finish organizing the files. A message box will appear when the process is complete.

## Notes

- The script will rename files to remove any dots between words in the file name and add the file type extension.
- The script will move files to a subdirectory named after their file type.
- The script works on nested folders, so it will organize files in subdirectories as well.
- The script has been tested on Windows and Linux systems.
